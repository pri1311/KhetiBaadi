# KhetiBadi

An app to facilitate farmers to consume information over a simple, multilingual interface that works like “Alexa/Hello Google” and the farmers can get curated information.

## The problem KhetiBaadi solves
There is a lot of information spread on the internet that can help a
farmer. Farmers are not tech savvy, barely use smart phones and are unable to
consume this information. We want to facilitate farmers to consume
information over a simple, multilingual interface that works like “Alexa/Hello
Google” and the farmers can get curated information. We want to help them at
all the stages of the farming process.
1. Integrate with “Hello Google”/Alexa [TODO]
2. Integrate with IVR auto-assistants [TODO]
Some of the examples of questions/problems that farmers may have are
mentioned below.
3. Where can I find “Urea”?
4. Which is the best retailer around me?
5. What are the pests danger around me?
6. What is the price of rice in my mandi?
7. Search fertilizer products with parameters such as product name,
company name, location proximity.
8. Search dealers with parameters such as dealers selling particular
products/brands, in a particular location, dealers with particular products
in-stock
9. What is my soil health?

## Challenges we ran into
- Difficult to implement voice assistant with different languages and variation in human phrases.
- Integrating flask with flutter

## Technologies we used
- Flutter/Dart
- Flask
- BeautifulSoup
